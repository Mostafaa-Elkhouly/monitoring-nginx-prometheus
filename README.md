## Introduction

This project aims to deploy a set of services within a specific Kubernetes namespace and establish a robust monitoring and alerting system using Prometheus, Grafana, and email notifications. The following services will be deployed and monitored:

- Nginx service running on Kubernetes pods.
- Nginx service exporter utilizing a Helm chart for seamless deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- A Kubernetes cluster up and running.
- Helm installed for managing Kubernetes applications.
- Basic knowledge of Kubernetes, Helm, Prometheus, and Grafana.

## Deployment

1. **Deploy Nginx Service on Kubernetes Pod:**

   Describe the steps to deploy the Nginx service within your specific Kubernetes namespace.

2. **Setup Nginx Service Exporter using Helm Chart:**

   Utilize the Helm chart to set up the Nginx service exporter, which collects metrics from the Nginx service for monitoring.

## Monitoring and Alerting

1. **Monitor Nginx Exporter with Prometheus:**

   Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from the Nginx service exporter and store them for analysis.

2. **Visualize Metrics with Grafana:**

   Set up Grafana to visualize the metrics collected by Prometheus, providing a user-friendly dashboard.

3. **Alerting through Email:**

   Configure alerting rules within Prometheus to trigger email notifications based on defined thresholds or anomalies.
